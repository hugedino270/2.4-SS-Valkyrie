# #fan_speed: 1.0
# #   The fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the fan
# #   will be set to when a heater or stepper driver is active.
# #   The default is 1.0
# #idle_timeout:
# #   The amount of time (in seconds) after a stepper driver or heater
# #   was active and the fan should be kept running. The default
# #   is 30 seconds.
# #idle_speed:
# #   The fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the fan
# #   will be set to when a heater or stepper driver was active and
# #   before the idle_timeout is reached. The default is fan_speed.
# #heater:
# #stepper:
# #   Name of the config section defining the heater/stepper that this fan
# #   is associated with. If a comma separated list of heater/stepper names
# #   is provided here, then the fan will be enabled when any of the given
# #   heaters/steppers are enabled. The default heater is "extruder", the
# #   default stepper is all of them.
